## ---------- variables allow to contain values that we want to use several times in our scripts -----------------

#in our script, Serge is used 4 times, so good scripting practice requires us to create a variable to hold the Name. 
# If the name is no longer the same, we will only have to change the value of our variable

name=Tee


echo "$name is a very hard working lady"
echo "The manger says, she will hire $name in her new team wherever she goes"
echo "$name likes to show off because the manger loves her"
echo "$name will always be available when they need her"
